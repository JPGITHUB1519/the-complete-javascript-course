Inheritance summary on ES5

ParentClass: Person
Subclass: Athlete

1- On the Subclass parent contructor you should call the parent contructor with the call method

  Person.call(this, name, yearOfBirth, job);

2- Assign the Prototype of the Subclass to a instance of the Object.create(ParentConstructor):
  Athlete.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);



Concepts:
  Object.create() -> method used to create a new object with the specified prototype


Prototype VS __proto__

  In reality, the only true difference between prototype and __proto__ is that the former is a property of a class constructor,
   while the latter is a property of a class instance.
